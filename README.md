# PISCINE UNITY 42

The Piscine is a 2 weeks training session in which we discover and learn a language, a framework or in this case how to use Unity.

Basically everyday we had to make a game to learn and practice differents parts of Unity and game programming in general.
The first week was focused on 2D games and the other one on 3D.

At the end of each week, we had what we call a 'rush': We had 2 days to make a real game based on what we learnedm just like in a game jam.
