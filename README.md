# PISCINE UNITY 42

The Piscine is a 2 weeks training session in which we discover and learn a language, a framework or in this case how to use Unity.

Basically everyday we had to make a game to learn and practice differents parts of Unity and game programming in general.

At the end of each week, we had what we call a 'rush': We had 2 days to make a real game based on what we learned.
